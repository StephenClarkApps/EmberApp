#  Ember Bus App

This app allow you to view and track ember bus trips. 

Currently it's hard coded to show "Trips" between Dundee and Edinburgh, and it lists these upcoming and current trips in the map tab.
 
Tapping a trip takes the user to a map of the bus's location, and so for a current trip, where the begning of the trip is in the past and the end in the future, it allow you to track the bus and tap a button at the bottom of the screen to open a full list of stops with the scheduled and estimated times to arrive and leave each stop.

Also on the same screen the user can see the seats, wheelchair and bike spots on the bus. 


This app is programmed in Swift using an approach based on SwiftUI and Combine, and leveraging an MVVM architecture. 

The app was built using XCode Version 15.2.

Target iOS version: 17.2 or later
